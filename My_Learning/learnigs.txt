(Q)Why should we use map?
ans: map returns an array of promises: When you use map with an async callback, it returns an array of promises.
 Each promise represents the result of the asynchronous operation for each element of the array.

 whereas,forEach doesn't handle promises: forEach iterates over the array and executes the callback function on 
 each element without waiting for any asynchronous operations inside the callback to complete. This can lead to 
 unanticipated behavior because the array waiters might not be populated correctly by the time you try to return it.
